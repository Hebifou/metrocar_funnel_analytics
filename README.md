Metrocar – Funnel & Retention Analytics

This project demonstrates an end-to-end growth funnel and retention analysis using simulated data from a fictional ride-sharing company, Metrocar.  
It replicates a typical growth analytics workflow — from SQL-style exploration to Python-based visualization — to identify key bottlenecks and retention patterns in the user lifecycle.

All results are reproducible and based on publicly shareable, simulated data.
